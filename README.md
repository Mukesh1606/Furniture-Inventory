# Furniture-Inventory
A web based project developed using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and MongoDB. It is used to store the records of the Furnitures in the IT department of our college. It indicates whether the particular item is in use or not. If it is in use, it stores the concerned staff details who is using it.

It has three sections, Staff, Staff-Admin, HOD.

In the staff section, the staff has the licence to move their currently using item to other staff and upon receiving the request staff2 confirms and verifies whether he/she received the item or not.

In the staff admin section, admin can add the newly purchased item and can able to assign it to the staffs. the added information would be the date of purchase, price, tax amount etc.,

In the HOD section, the HOD only monitors all these records and intimates the staff admin if any error found.


To run this project, clone it and install the necessary node modules using **npm init** and use the command **npm start** to start the application.
